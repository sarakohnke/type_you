# Type_you
Type_you is a web app designed to help physicians provide personalized treatment for their patients with type 2 diabetes. More specifically, it helps them to find interventions that are predicted to lower a particular patient’s A1C score.

# Motivation
A1C is a measure of recent blood sugar levels and can be a marker of how well diabetes is being managed. We know that lowering it to near-normal range can significantly reduce the risk of common complications of type 2 diabetes. However, 50% of patients do not reach their A1c target.

# How to use
The vision for the app is that it will link directly with patient EMR data, but in the meantime I’ve uploaded some sample patient data the user can choose from the dropdown box. The user can see all the measurements associated with this patient and view their current A1C score. Then, the user can chose interventions from the sidebar to see how they are predicted to affect the patient’s A1C.  Clicking the button 'See how your chosen interventions are predicted to affect this patient's A1C' will show the new predicted score.

The advice of my peers and mentors at the Insight Data Science program have been invaluable in the process of producing the app.
